# Color Panels

#### A brief description of what this project does.

It is a simple and very fast color scheme generator. This is probably my favorite tool when it comes to exploring different color combinations from scratch.

When you enter the website it generates a palette of 5 colors that play well together. You can easily create a new color scheme by hitting the spacebar, and if you like one or more of the colors then click on the color and it will lock so it doesn't change the next time you hit spacebar.

After a palette of matching colors has been selected, you can simply copy the URL or bookmark it for further reference. I really like the direct link feature, since you don't need to create a profile to use the site.
